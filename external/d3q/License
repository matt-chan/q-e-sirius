All source files are licenced with the GPLv2 licence, when possible
we also licenced a file with "GPLv2 and following" which includes currently
the GPLv3 version. When possible, we also used the CeCILL licence as
recommended for any work financed by the French CNRS.

Please see the precise licencing information at the beginning of each file
and the licences text in Doc/Licence

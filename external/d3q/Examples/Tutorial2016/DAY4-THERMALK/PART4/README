Using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, we will investigate the 
effect of scattering.

Modify the sample input file to compute the thermal conductivity at four 
temperatures: 10, 100, 300 and 1000K

How many iterations does it take for the conjugate gradient algorithm to reach 
the solution?

Plot the converged k vs T and compare it with the SMA approximation

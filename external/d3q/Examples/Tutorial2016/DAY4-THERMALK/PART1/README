In this part we will run the calculation of the thermal conductivity with the 
tk.x code from thermal2.

This code reads the matrices of harmonic force constants (mat2R) and the 3rd 
order anharmonic force constants (mat3R), and uses them to compute the thermal 
conductivity.

In this part we will use it to compute the thermal conductivity of silicon 
within the single-mode relaxation time approximation.

Modify the input file and compute the thermal conductivity at four 
temperatures: 10, 100, 300 and 1000K, you can use more configurations to get a 
better resolution of the curve

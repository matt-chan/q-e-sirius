In these exercises you will see how to set up an input file for the tk.x code
to compute the thermal conductivity of bulk Silicon; either using the 
single-mode relaxation time approximation (SMA) or solving exactly the
linearized Boltzmann transport equation (BTE).

For your convenience, the files mat2 and mat3R.asr.sparse from
PART2 of DAY3 have already been copied to this directory.

PART1: k within single-mode relaxation time approximation (k vs T)
PART2: k within single-mode relaxation time approximation (k vs L)
PART3: k within single-mode relaxation time approximation (Isotopes 
         contribution in k vs T`) 
PART4: k within Variational solution of the linearized BTE  (k vs T)... to be 
         compared with the SMA in PART1
PART5: k within Variational soltution of the linearized BTE (k vs L)... to be 
         compared with the SMA in PART2
PART6: k within Variational solution of the linearized BTE (Isotopes 
         contribution in k vs T`)... to be compared with the SMA in PART3

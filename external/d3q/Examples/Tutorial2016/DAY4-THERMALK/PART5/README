In this part we will compute the thermal conductivity, solving exactly the 
Boltzmann transport equation. To solve it, we will use the preconditioned 
conjugate gradient minimizer

Modify the sample input file for computing the thermal conductivity at 
different Lcas: from 0.1 microm to 1 mm ( select a reasonable length step). 

Plot then k vs L and compare the results with the sma results obtained in 
part2. 

What do you observe?

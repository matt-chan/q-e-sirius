Modify the sample input file to compute the thermal conductivity at four 
temperatures: 10, 100, 300 and 1000K with the isotopic scattering contribution.

Compare it with the SMA results in part3. Are you able to tell for which 
Temperature regions, the different phonon interactions (border, anharmonic, 
isotopes)
are more relevants than the others?

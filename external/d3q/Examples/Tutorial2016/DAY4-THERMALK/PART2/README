In this part we will run the calculation of the thermal conductivity with the 
tk.x code from thermal2.

This code reads the matrices of harmonic force constants (mat2R) and the 3rd 
order anharmonic force constants (mat3R), and uses them to compute the thermal 
conductivity.

In this part we will use it to compute the thermal conductivity of silicon 
within the single-mode relaxation time approximation.

Modify now the input file for computing the thermal conductivity at different 
Lcas: from 0.1 microm to 1 mm ( select a reasonable length step). Plot then k 
vs L. What do you observe? What does this trend represent?

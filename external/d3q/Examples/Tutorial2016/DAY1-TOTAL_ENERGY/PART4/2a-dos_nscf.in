! Now we will see how to compute the density of
! states (DOS) for the aluminium bulk crystal.

! The Marzari-Vanderbilt smearing we have used 
! before insure a faster convergence, but may
! produce a small negative DOS at some energies.
!
! Instead you can use the simpler "gaussian"
! smearing, wich take more points to converge
! but doesn't have such artifacts.

! In order to have a better plot we take a 
! smaller smearing and increse the number of 
! kpoints slightly:

 After running the calculation you open the file
 2b-dos.in for instruction on how to plot the DOS

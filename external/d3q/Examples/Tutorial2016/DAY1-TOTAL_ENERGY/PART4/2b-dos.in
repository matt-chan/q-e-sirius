! 
! This is an example input file that you can
! feed to dos.x in order to plot the density
! of states for the aluminium calculation.
!
 &dos
    prefix='aluminium' ! the same as before
    outdir='../tmp/'   ! the same as before
!
! The output file, specified by the fildos
! parameter, will be a 3-columns text file:
!  * the first column is the energy 
!  * the second the density of states
!  * the third contains the integral of DOS
!
    fildos='aluminium.dos',
!
! The following three parameters specify the
! minimum, the maximum and the step of the 
! energy range in which the DOS is computed
! (they are all in eV):
!
    Emin= -5.0,
    Emax= 45.0,
    DeltaE=0.05
 /
!
! To plot the density of states you can use
! the command line utilities gnuplot, with
! command like this:
!  plot 'aluminium.dos' with lines
!

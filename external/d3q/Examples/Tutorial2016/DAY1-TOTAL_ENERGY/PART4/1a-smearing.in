! For metals reciprocal space integration is not as easy
! as for insulators. The reason is that some band are only
! partially filled, generating a Fermi energy and a Fermi
! surface (FS).
!
! I theory reciprocal space integration should be performed
! on all and only the kpoint inside the FS. On the other
! hand this is extremily slow to converge: to obtain a 
! reliable result you shoud use millions of kpoints.
!
! To work aroiund this problem you can use a smearing, i.e.
! the occupation is not sharply one inside the fermi surface
! and zero outside, but is smoothed using some kind of
! smearing function.
!
! There are different kind of smearings, each of one serve
! a different purpose; in this example you will use a general
! purpose  "cold smearing" formulated by Marzari and Vanderbilt.
! The smearing is also influenced by the degauss parameter
! which specify how soft the smearing function will be.
!
! The correct way to converge the system is to first fix the
! degauss then increase the number of kpoint (as you did for
! Silicon) until the energy converges. 
!
! Try to converge the energy, incresing the number of kpoints
! for three different value of the degauss: 0.50, 0.05 and 0.01 Ry. 
!
    occupations = 'smearing',
      smearing = 'marzari-vanderbilt',
        degauss = XXX
!
! HINTS:
!
! Notice the "smearing contribution" to the total energy, printed
! at the end of the output. It should be in the order of 1 mRy or
! smaller.
!
! Also note how the number of points differs considerably from
! X*X*X because symmetries are used to reduce them. 
!
! You can expect the first value to converge very fast, but deal
! bad results, the second to converge relatively fast to an
! acceptable result, while the smaller degauss will likely require
! a hunderd of points to converge!

!
! Now we want to compute the band structure of
! Silicon; in order to do so we redo a calculation
! at the optimal volume, with a good cutoff and 
! well converged kpointa.
!
 &control
    calculation = 'scf'
    prefix='silicon' 
    pseudo_dir = '../'
    outdir='../tmp/'
 /
 &system
    ibrav=  2,
       celldm(1) =10.20,
    ntyp= 1,
    nat=  2,
!
! Silicon has 4 valence (occupied) bands, for this
! plot we also want a few conduction (empty) bands.
! In order to generate more bands you can use the
! "nbdn" keyword:
!
    nbnd=8
!
! Notice than using more than the minimum number
! of bands the program will also print the highest
! occupied and the lowest unoccupied levels:
! the difference between them is the band gap. 
!
    ecutwfc = 24.
    occupations='fixed'

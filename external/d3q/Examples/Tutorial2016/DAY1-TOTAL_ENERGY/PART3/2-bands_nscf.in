! The bands calculation is not self-consistent,
! it means that it uses the potential and charge
! density from a previous calculation and use it
! to compute the desired quantity without doing
! any iteration.
!
! You have to specify 'bands' as the calculation
! type:
!
    calculation = 'bands'
!
! The prefix and the outdir must be the same of
! the scf calculation you have done in step 4a, 
! otherwise pw.x will not be able to find the data!
!
    prefix='silicon' 
    pseudo_dir = '../'
    outdir='../tmp/'

! calculation, but we may want to plot to see the band-gap

! Finally you have specify a path in the reciprocal
! space along which the bands will be plotted. 
! The most convenient way to do it is to manually 
! specify the points in units of 2 pi/alat, this
! is specified by the keyword "tpiba_b", the 4th number
! specifies the amount of intermidiate points in each
! path segment
!

   0.50 0.50 0.50   50 ! "L" point
   0.00 0.00 0.00   40 ! "Gamma" point
   0.00 0.00 1.00   20 ! "X" point
   0.00 0.50 1.00   40 ! "W" point
   0.00 0.00 0.00    0 ! "Gamma" point

 Now just run the calculation: as everything is
 already set up. Notice that pw.x will not produce
 any data file: it just prepares the necessary
 quantities that another program, bands.x, will
 then extract.
 
 The exercises continue with the file 4b-bands.in

! This is an imput file for bands.x, as you can
! see it is much simpler than a typical pw.x
! input.
! 
! All you have to specify is:
!
 &bands
    prefix  = 'silicon'    ! must be the same as in the
                           ! pw.x calculation
                           !
    outdir = '../tmp'      ! must be the same as in pw.x
                           !
    filband = 'sibands.dat'! the file where the band data
                           ! will be stored
!
! Now just run this calculation, it will take a few seconds.
! When it finished you will noticed that the file "sibands.dat"
! will be present in the current directory.
!
! You can use the program plotbands.x to generate a plot, it
! is an interactive program, so just run it and answer its
! questions.
! 
! The input file will be the newly produced "sibands.dat",
! select a energy range large enough to contain all the bands.
! As the fermi energy you can specify the middle of the gap:
! about 6.5eV. 
!
! plotband.x produces a postscript file (that you can visualize
! with kghostview) and an xmgr file (that you can plot with xmgrace). 
!
! If you prefer, you can plot the file sibands.dat.gnu directly
! using gnuplot
!

Here we will see how to compute and plot the electronic
bands of Silicon. First we will repeat the SCF calculation with
well converged parameters; second we will non-self consistently
compute the electronic bands for a list of k-points tracing
a path in the Brillouin zone.

Finally, we will use the program bands.x to extract the band
and analize their symmetry or continuity. And plot the result
with the plotbands.x code, or using gnuplot.

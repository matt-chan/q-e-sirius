! Now we are back to the FCC structure with 2 atoms
! per unit cell. It means that the BZ is now 4 times
! larger: in order to get the same results as in the
! previous case we need 4 times as many kpoints...

! It is not easy to visualize the correspondence
! between the simple cubic BZ and the face-
! centered BZ.
!
! What happens is that the single Gamma point in the
! SC case unfolds to 4 different points in the FCC case
! The first of these points is the SC Gamma point,
! the other three are X point: points that are in the
! center of a face of the BZ.
!
! The following cards specify exactly this situation:

 Try to run this calculation, compute the energy per atom
 and verify how it correspond exactly (at least at the
 required precision) to the previous case.

 Now try to make the calculation faster: for symmetry reasons
 the 3 X-points are equivalent. Instead of specifying them
 separately we can specify only one of them but using a weight
 three times larger!

 Modify the K_POINTS section accordingly and rerun the
 calculation; verify how it deals exactly the same results as
 before, to all significant digits.

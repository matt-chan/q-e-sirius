This directory contains the exmple files for the first part
of the tutorial, this span on the following topics:

1. convergence with respect to the cutoff energy

2. convergence with respect to the number of special
   points for Brillouin zone integration

3. simple structural optimization: search for the 
   optimal volume

4. computing and plotting the band structure

The test system is a simple Silicon crystal.

To get started open the first file (1a-cutoff.in) with
you favourite text editor (e.g. kwrite).

! The last and more difficult quantity to converge
! (for now!) is the number of k-points. This exercise
! spans on three different files: this one, step 2b
! and step 2c.

! To start, you should observe that the face-centered
! cell with 2 Silicon atoms is equivalent to a simple
! cubic cell with 8 atoms: to verify this fact you can
! use xcrysden to visualize the crystal structure.
!
! From xcrysden navigate the menu "File" -> "Open PWscf"
!  -> "PWscf input file"; from there open step3b.in
! and step3a.in.
! Cycle between the conventional cell mode and the
! primitive cell mode in the Display Menu, when you think
! you have understood the difference come back here to 
! continue the exercise.
!
! You should have noticed that the simple cubic cell has
! a volume 4 times larger than the face-centered one:
! as you know it means that the brillouin zone is 4 times
! smaller!
!
    ibrav=1,           ! Here we are using Face-Center Cubic (FCC) 
      celldm(1)=10.20, ! celldm(1) is the same as before, but the 
                       ! volume of the cell if 4 times larger, because
                       ! of the definition of the lattice basis
    ntyp=1,
    nat=8,             !  8 atoms per cell

! The selection of kpoints defines a sampling of the
! Brillouin zone (BZ), each point correspond to a category
! of Bloch wavefunctions with a certain periodicity.
! 
! To get started we will do a calculation with a single
! kpoint: the Gamma point (0,0,0).
! There are several ways to specify the kpoints, for
! now we will use the manual method: 
!
K_POINTS tpiba      ! <-- unit of measure 2 pi / alat
1                   ! nuber of kpoints
  0.0 0.0 0.0  1.00 ! its coordinates and its weight

 We will see the meaning of the weight in the next
 step. For now just run the calculation, take note of
 the total energy and compute the energy per atom:
   e_atom = e_tot / nat

 Then move to 2b-kpoints.in

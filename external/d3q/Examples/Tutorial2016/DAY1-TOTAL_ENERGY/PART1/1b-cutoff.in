! Using the suggested value for the wfc cutoff is a
! starting point, but if you want to do some serious
! calculation you must do a proper convergence test.
!
! Try to use half a dozen values for ecutwfc between 16 Ry
! and 40 Ry, each time you will have to run the calculation
! and take note of the total energy.
! Using this data you can plot a graph of the energy as a
! function of the cutoff (you can use gnuplot or xmgrace).

    ecutwfc = XXX,

! When you have plotted the data you can estrapolate the
! optimal cutoff: 1 mRy is usually considered a sufficient
! convergence threshold for most calculations.

 Learning some bash (the linux command prompt) scripting
 will save you a lot of time in the future. A good starting
 point is the Advanced Bash Script Guid from www.tldp.org 

 P.S. a UNIX wizard would do it this way:

 for i in $(seq 16 4 40);do
      echo -n "$i  ";
      sed -e "s/XXX/$i/" 1b-cutoff.in |pw.x|awk '/^!/ {print $5}';
 done | tee ecut-conv.txt

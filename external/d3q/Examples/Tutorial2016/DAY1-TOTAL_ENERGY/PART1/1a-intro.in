! This is a typical input file for pw.x you can run it typing
! a command like ``pw.x < step1.in''.
!
! Lines starting with `!' are ignored, you can use them to
! comment the file.
!
! The file is divided in namelists, each namelist start with
! &namelist_name
! and ends with a single `/'.
!
 &control
! The control namelist contains some platform-specific
! informations of no physical importance:
    calculation = 'scf' ! for now we are only doing simple
                        ! self-consistent calculations
                        !
    prefix='silicon'    ! the name of the job
                        !
    pseudo_dir = '../'  ! where the pseudopotentials files
                        ! are located
                        !
    outdir='../tmp/'    ! the place where temporary files
                        ! will be stored
 /
 &system
! The system namelist contains a description of the 
! physical system:
    ibrav=  2,           !kind of bravais lattice (FCC)
       celldm(1) =10.20, !lattice parameter (in a.u.), this is
                         !often called "alat" or simply "a"
    ntyp= 1,             !number of elements
    nat=  2,             !number of atoms
!  
! The aim of this exercise is to study the convergence of
! the total energy functional with respect to ecutwfc:
    ecutwfc = XXX,
! it is namely the wavefunctions cutoff, expressed in Rydberg
! atomic units. It means that wavefunctions will be expandend
! in a basis of plane waves up to the maximum energy ecutwfc.
!
! Choosing a good value for the cutoff is the first step to any
! plane-wave based calculation. A good starting value can usually
! be found at the beginning of the pseudopotential file.
!
! Why don't you take a look at it in ``Si.pz-rrkj.UPF''?
! Replace XXX with the suggested value and try to run the
! calculation.

 Additional lines at the end of the file are ignored,
 I will use them to put some final remark, but you can skip
 them you don't have much time.

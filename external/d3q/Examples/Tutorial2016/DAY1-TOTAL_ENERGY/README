This introduction tutoria to quantum espresso
is comprised of four parts:

1. We will see how to set up a calculation of Silicon
   and converge all the computational parameters

2. We will then see how to optimize the crystal geometry

3. We will compute and plot Silicon electronic bands

4. (optional) We will switch to Aluminium to study
   the use of electronic temperature (smearing) to
   converge the k-point integral of the Brillouin zone

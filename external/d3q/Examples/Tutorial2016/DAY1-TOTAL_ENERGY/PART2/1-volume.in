! Until now we have used the experimental lattice
! legth; even if it may see ma good idea it is
! better to use the computed legth. The experimental
! value correspond to a system which feel a strain,
! this effect can alter the result of subsequent
! calculations.
!
! The FCC structure is described by a single parameter
! specified by the keyword celldm(1), it is specified.
! in bohr atomic units.
! Take a dozen different values between 10.00 and 10.40,
! run a calculation for each and plot a curve of the
! total energy as a function of celldm(1):
    ibrav=  2,          
       celldm(1) =XXX,
    ntyp= 1,            
    nat=  2,
!
! Now I want you to see how the total energy is not the
! better quantity to check for the system convergence:
! try to repeat the step above using a smaller ecutwfc,
! such as 16 Ry or even less, use this data to plot
! another curve and compare it with the first one:
!
    ecutwfc = 24., ! This is a well converged value

 You may have noticed that even if at a cutoff of 16 Ry the
 total energy is well above the converged value, the E[celldm]
 curve has its minimum almost exactly at the same point.

 In general crystal force and stress converge slower than
 total energy. On the other hand, energy differences can
 converge faster than absolute energy. Phonos (day 2) can
 be especially tricky to converge!

! Relaxing the structure manually can be cumbersome
! especially when a system as more than one degree
! of freedom. The code can do it automatically using
! a minimization algorithm, when required:
    calculation = 'vc-relax'
    prefix='silicon'
    pseudo_dir = '../'
    outdir='../tmp/'

ATOMIC_SPECIES

! We can break symmetry to explore the possibility
! of lower-symmetry structures:
ATOMIC_POSITIONS
 Si 0.00 0.00 0.00
 Si 0.23 0.26 0.25
K_POINTS automatic
 4 4 4  0 0 0

! Just run the calculation and see where it converges
! is it the same structure as before?

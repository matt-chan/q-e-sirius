This Exercises were designed for the 
Psi-K Quantum-ESPRESSO School on Ab-Initio Thermal Transport
that was hosted in Paris in June 2016.

DAY1 : basis of DFT calculation with pw.x, testing convergence and more

DAY2 : computing and interpolating phonons with ph.x, q2r.x and matdyn.x

DAY3 : computing anharmonic force constants using the d3q.x code and 
       using them to compute the phonon linewidth.

DAY4 : thermal conductivity calculation in the SIngle-mode Approximation 
       abd solving exactly the Boltzmann equation.


In every directory you will find README files which will explain the steps
to follow to reproduce the results.

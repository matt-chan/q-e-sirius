In this part we will run the 3rd order DFPT calculation, with the d3q.x code.

This code will read drho (the variation of the charge density
w.r.t a phonon perturbation) and use it to compute
non-self consistently the |d psi> and the generalized third order
dynamical "tensor" for a 2x2x2 grid of triplets. 

The code can also be used to compute a single triplet, or just a
sub-grid centered around a special point (i.e. Gamma) see the
documentation for more information.

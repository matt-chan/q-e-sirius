Today we will see how to run a calculation of the
third order dynamical matrices, using the 2n+1 
linear response and how to use these matrices
to compute phonon-phonon interactions.

PART1: how to run the d3q.x calculation, rerunning
       pw.x and ph.x if necessary

PART2: use a special version of q2r.x to compute
       optimized force constants and write them
       to file.

       Use three tools from the D3Q/thermal2 distribution
       to compute the 3-body force constants, apply the 
       generalized sum rule and optimize them.

PART3: compute and test the convergence of ph-ph interaction
       with the size of the q-space grid used to integrate
       it

PART4: compute the phonon linewidth (inverse lifetime)
       along a path in the brillouin zone

PART5: compute the phonon spectra function \sigma(w) for 
       a strongly anharmonic system (PdH)

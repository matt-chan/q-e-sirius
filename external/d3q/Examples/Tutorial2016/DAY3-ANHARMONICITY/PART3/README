In this part we will use the 2nd and 3rd order force constants to
compute the linewidth of Silicon at Gamma and study its convergence
with the grid used to integrate the phonon-phonon interaction.

We will use the code lw.x from thermal2. The file input.LW is 
set up to compute the linewidth at the Gamma point, at a 
temperature of 300K using 8 values of smearing between 0.1 and 10.0

Run the input file for half a dozen grid dimensions between 10x10x10
and 50x50x50. 
Do not forget to change the prefix to avoid overwriting files!

When you are done, extract the linewidth of the acoustical band and for 
every sigma and plot it as a function of the grid size.


Hint: in a system with 2 atoms, the output file of the linewidth contains
the following columns:
1) the line number
2) the cumulative length of the path (only useful with more than one input q-point!)
3 -> 5) coordinates of the q-point
6 -> 11) the phonon frequencies
12 -> 17) the corresponding linewidths
For our case, columns 15-16-17 contain the linewidths of acoustic phonon modes.

Try:
    awk '{print $15}' filename



Finally, choose a well converged configuration and compare the results
produced with the different sets of matrices from point 5 of part 2.
How much does the calculation time change? Does it substantially affect
the results?

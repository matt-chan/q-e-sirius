Compute the phonon spectra function, with the full equation
and simulate it as a superposition of Lorentzian functions,
centered on the phonon modes.

Silicon is not sufficiently anharmonic to see any difference
between the two calculations, hence we will use pre-computed
matrices from Palladium-hydride.

See how the phonon spectral function becomes more complicated
at higher temperature. Check which modes maintain a distinct
identity even in the presence of strong anharmonicity to
which atomic species do they correspond?

Note that in order to have the spectral function normalized
to the number of phonons you will have to multiply it
by the frequency (different papers use different definitions).

This lecture has the following plan:

PART1 - The phonon code is introduced. A calculation of the vibrational 
frequencies of Si at the gamma and X points is shown. The calculation of the 
electronic dielectric constant is also shown. Discussion of the input variables
and of the output variables. Description of the dynamical matrix file.

PART2 - The phonon code is used to calculate the dynamical matrix at 
a regular mesh of wave-vectors $q$ and the two codes q2r and matdyn 
for the calculation of the interatomic force constants and of the complete
phonon dispersions are illustrated.

PART3 - The frequencies obtained by interpolation are compared with the
frequencies obtained by the direct calculation of the dynamical matrix for
several wavevectors $q$.

In this part we will use the phonon code to compute all the phonons in a 4x4x4
regualr grid of q-points. The grid is automatically reduced, using symmetry,
to the minimum amount of inequivalent points.

We will also use the "drho_star" options of phonon to save the variation of the
charge density to files, that will be used tomorrow to compute the 3rd order
anharmonic terms. To rune the phonon calculation use:

 ph.x < ph.in

We will then use the code q2r.x to compute the Fourier transform of the dynamical matrices:
we will obtain the real-space force constants in a 4x4x4 supercell. The q2r code is 
run as:
  
  q2r.x < q2r.in

We will then use the code matdyn.x which uses Fourier interpolation starting from the force
constants to obtain the dynamical matrices (and phonon frequencies) along a path
in the brillouin zone. Verify the importance of enforcing the acoustic sum rule, try
different methods: "none", "simple", "crystal".

  matdyn.x < matdyn.in

We will plot the phonon frequencies together with the experimental ones
(stored in file "exp.dat"). You can use the gnuplot command in the file
plot.gnu, or any other plotting tool you want.

Here we ntroduce the phonon code.

First of all we will recompute the ground state electronic
structure with pw.x using the well-converged input from yesterday
pw.x < pw.in

Then we will compute the vibrational frequencies at Gamma:
 ph.x < ph-Gamma.in
this part also includes a calculation of the dielectric constant.

And finally the vibrational frequencies at the X point
ph.x < ph-X.in

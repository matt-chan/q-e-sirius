phonons at Gamma

!
! Note that this file starts with a title line,
! which is required!
! Run this input file with the ph.x code
   outdir='../tmp',
   prefix='silicon',

! epsil=.true. instructs the code to compute the
! dielectric constant
   epsil=.true.,
! 
! The file where the dynamical matrix will be saved:
   fildyn='dyn.G',
!
! The convergence threshold, this is a completely
! different quantity from the conv_thr of pw.x
! much smaller values are normally used
   tr2_ph=1.0d-16,
! When computing a single phonon, you just
! put its coordinates after the namelist
! in units of 2pi/alat

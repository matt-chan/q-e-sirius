The frequencies obtained by interpolation are compared with the frequencies 
obtained by the direct calculation of the dynamical matrix for several 
wavevectors q.

This is a list of q-points to use:
0.2  0.0  0.0
0.4  0.0  0.0
0.5  0.0  0.0
0.6  0.0  0.0
0.8  0.0  0.0
0.2  0.2  0.2
0.4  0.4  0.4
0.5  0.5  0.5

Each q-point schould be compute with matdyn (use the template matdyn.in)
and ph.x (use the template ph.in) Compare the difference in the results.

In order to convert the FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD file for the 
format used by thermal2 run the following command:

  d3_import_shengbte.x 2 2 2

This will read the system information from mat2R and the
force constants from FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD. 

The output file mat3R.shengbte contains the final force
constants in dense format. You can proceed to apply the sum
rules (which should not be necessary, as thirdorder.py applies
them itself) and make the force constants sparse with d3_sparse.x

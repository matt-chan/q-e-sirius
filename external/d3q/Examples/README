Two examples about the d3 calculations, in both we compute the full double-grid 
dispersion of  the D3 matrices:

Graphene : calculation of D3 matrices
           (NOTE: very far from convergence!!)
Silicon Â : calculation of D3 matrices, force constants,
           linewidth and thermal conductivity

mat3R.NULL : example of fake mat3R file that will produce zero anharmonicity, useful for testing

In the Tutorial2016 directory you will find the exercise from the Psi-K 
Quantum-ESPRESSO School on Ab-Initio Thermal Transport hosted in Paris in June 
2016. The exercises include verbose comments and explanations. 

We recommend that you reproduce the exercises in the Tutorial in order  to 
familiarize with the D3Q and thermal2 codes. If you are already familiar with 
Quantum-ESPRESSO calculation you may want to skip DAY1 (total energy 
calculation) and DAY2 (phonon calculation and interpolation).
